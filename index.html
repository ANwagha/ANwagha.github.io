    <h1>Kachi's Kurrents</h1>
    <img src="images/wave2.jpg" alt="A refelected image of the great wave off kanagawa" />
    <p>My website is about me, <a href= "https://nuhuskies.com/sports/mens-basketball/roster/alexander-nwagha/8345"> Kachi.</a> 
        I want to present all the current things I am interested in at 
        the moment, including and not limited to
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>movies</li>
            <li>books</li>
            <li>songs</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        I hope to have an image related to each
        Kurrent along with a short review of why I am fascinated by it. I like
        clean aesthics so my website will have a light blue background and use a 
        subtle sans serif font. This is because I feel like I am a very calm and chill
        person so I want the website to reflect that. My favourite piece of art is also Hokusai's Great Wave so I had
        to include it.
